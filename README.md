processing
During the lessons I mainly focused on mastering the programming language Java.
Because the processing works with Java and is often used with algorithms, this seemed an educational option to me.

1.project Growing Circles:

the aim of this project is to create an algorithm in which circles are placed on a frame. Each circle continues to grow.

general rules:

- Each circle has a random growth rate.
- When a circle touches the side or another circle, stop growth
- New circles cannot spawn inside another circle

2. Create Sphere project:

The goal of this project is to create a sphere within an engine yourself.

instructions:

you can move around with the mouse.

3.Lorenz Attractor project:

The goal of this project is to visualize Chaos Theory, in which a small change in the initial input and output completely changes and you get a completely different picture.

instructions:

you can move around with the mouse.

4. Project MetaBalls:

In this project I bounce light bulbs around within a frame.

how does it work:

The brightness of the light depends on the distance from the other bulbs. When a sphere is close, the surrounding light on the sphere becomes brighter, this gives a very nice effect.

5.Project Color Detection:
I have always found face recognition very interesting. During this project I wanted to make a basic version of it.

how does it work:
The program detects via the webcam whether there is an object with the color light blue.
then a circle is placed on the center of the selected pixels and follow this circle also the blue object.

instructions:

Use the mouse button to recalibrate the program
